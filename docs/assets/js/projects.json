We will introduce a pay-per-lead model, a first for maternal websites, where doulas invest a small fee to connect with mothers. This integration not only opens a revenue stream for M.O.M, but it also means expanding services, growing the team, and making a positive impact on more mothers’ and childrens’ lives.",

Instead of handing out the master key, applicants will receive their own key with specific permissions determined by our client, the Assistant Director of Student Activities. At a high level, our system will have a front-end website where users sign on and use a text based form to request user keys for themselves. Key requests need to be approved by a list of staff approvers, who can leave comments and assign permissions to each application. Successful 7 implementation will remove barriers in allowing student developers on campus to create meaningful applications relevant to Carnegie Mellon’s student activities and events and provide value to the campus community, while maintaining the security of the information on the Bridge.",

The web page will have two main users - CMU faculty and staff, and Professional Development Services staff. The first use is for employees to assess their competency level, and be presented with resources and a plan on how to maintain and/or develop their selected competency. Paired with a plan of action, CMU faculty and staff will be more motivated to follow through with their development. The second use of the system is for Professional Development Services staff, or equivalent administrators, to access the system and customize the content. This includes modifying the assessment itself, altering the interpretation algorithm, and adding/removing/editing competencies and resources.",

When grantee programs submit their reports, the app would rename the file appropriately and sort them into the relevant folders, reducing the manual labor on both our client and the grantee programs.

Currently, the data is spread out across three systems and is resulting in a loss of time and efficiency. Our project will significantly speed up the transfer of information in the organization regarding their vehicle fleet. This will allow requests and lookups for informatyion to be significantly easier and faster than before. While we could propose solutions using other database systems or software, such as a Ruby on Rails app, this idea offered by the client seems to be most appropriate due to the client's prior experience with the software and maintainability.",

The top priorities for application functionality were customer onboarding, customer sign-in, scheduling, and payment. The functionality of AcuityScheduling covered these use cases, and Squarespace also has a plugin for Acuity which made integration straightforward. Both services have mobile-responsive solutions, which is suitable for the client and their customers, given their preference for a mobile-friendly solution.

Childbirth trauma increases the likelihood of postpartum depression and can negatively impact the important mother-baby bond.

They also reached out to the game developer suggesting Lakota language be added to the game.",
