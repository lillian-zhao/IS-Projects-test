We created our solution using a Ruby on Rails application hosted on an IS department server, cmuisprojects.org, with a server provided by Auberle’s third party IT vendor (Ideal Integrations). The stakeholders for our application are the Foster Care Director, Ideal Integrations, the Director of Facilities and Operations, case specialists and aides, along with foster 31 families and childern.
